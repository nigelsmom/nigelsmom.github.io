           <h2>Why did you create the blog Sweetlenox.com?</h2>
            
               <p>
                 After being diagnosed with Stage 1 Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
                in February 2015, I went thru a period of challenges that effected 
                my life dramtically.  Although I put together one of the best 
                medical teams in NYC, I still experienced a deep learning curve. 
                Understanding how to manage a chronic diagnosis such as breast cancer
                is an enormous undertaking, and without education, guidance and support
                it can be extremely confusing and islolating.  I created Sweetlenox.com
                as a two fold entity.  Part one a.k.a. "The Believers" section 
                is chock full of interviews and information highlighting providers who are 
                truly passionate about their field.  Whether it be artists covering 
                scars, patient navigators getting bills paid or biologist talking about
                the latest clinical trails, I'm putting the spotlight on the brightest
                and the best!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The second part of Sweetlenox.com is my personal blog, detailing
                my journey over the last year (going thru treatment) and chronicles 
                some of the wonderful folks I've met along the way. Throughout 
                2016 I've had the honor of chatting it up with and rubbing 
                shoulders with some of the the most passionate people in art, biology,
                fashion, urban farming, nutrition, and breast cancer advocacey.  
                All of these special people have one thing in common: To make live more 
                accesible, creative, fun and managable for Breast Cancer Survivors!
